# Code Quiz

## Description

In this homework assignment, I was tasked to develop a timed coding assessment consisting of multiple choice questions using the concepts introduced in this week's module.  Using this assessment, coding students can gauge his/her progress compared to peers, as shown on the high scores leader board.

## Acceptance Criteria

I was asked to comply with the following acceptance criteria:

```
* When I click the start button, a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
* When I answer a question, I am presented with another question.
* When I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock as a penalty.
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the assessment is over.
* When the assessment is over, I can save my initials and score.

```
